	  <ul class="faq"> 
	    
	    <li class="faq_question">Where is season one?</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li class="faq_answer"> No one really knows. It is likely unavailable to Hulu, CrunchyRoll
					and other streaming sites due to licensing conflicts (i.e some network
					somewhere still has the rights to that season). I <i>could</i> upload it
					myself- nah, just kidding.
				</li>
		    </ul>
        </li>
		
		<li class="faq_question">Can I download these episodes?</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li class="faq_answer">
					Not from this site.... Hell Girl episodes can be downloaded from
					<a class="faq" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hell-Girl/dp/B001MWTYZ2"> Amazon Instant </a>.			 
				</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>	

		<li class="faq_question">What's your favorite episode?</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li class="faq_answer">
					Season 3's  <a class="faq" href="the_rabbit_and_the_turtle.html"> 
					The Rabbit and the Turtle.</a> I identify greatly with the main 
					character. That and Episode 6 of the short-lived live action series.
				</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>	
		
		<li class="faq_question">What's your favorite season?</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li class="faq_answer">
					I'd have to say season 3, because the show really ramps up on 
					the twist endings and grey areas. Going back and watching season 1
					after becoming accustomed to season 2 and 3 was such a disappointment. 
				</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>	

		<li class="faq_question">How do you feel about the Hell Girl manga?</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li class="faq_answer">
					Never got around to reading it. 
				</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>	

		<li class="faq_question">How do you feel about the live action series?</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li class="faq_answer">
					It seemed rushed. I mean, you can't expect much from it, 
					but it sort of started off using plot devices from the 
					anime but never really saw them to their conclusion. This
					bugged me. Other than that, it was alright. There were 
					a couple of gems and I was surprised how well the series
					lended itself to live action.
