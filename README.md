Hotline-To-Hell-Girl
====================
Full Site: http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~aheard7/hotline_to_hell_girl/ 

Video streaming site using only JS, HTML, XML and a page generator (parsed the XML
and wrote my own HTML templates to a file based on it) in Java.  School project. 

Started out intending to be written in PHP in SQL, changed when I realized that I couldn't
do that for the course. Because of the specifications of the site for my classes' grading
server,  everything (images, scripts, etc) were put in the same folder.  The folders in
this repository are just collections of code that don't represent the file structure 
of the site.
